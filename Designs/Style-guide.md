## Colour use
Here, 'blocks' refers to the blocks of colour, or cards, seen on the site. Their purpose is to add a little more interesting and colourfull visuals to the site. 

The background of the site is standard the off-white colour, but to add more variation longer pages have different backgrounds per section. One section is one topic.

|    | **Background** | **Block** | **Text**  |
|------------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| **blocks** | #1B525C        | #80C87F   | #1B525C   
|      | #80C87F        | #1B525C   | #FFFCEE   |  
|       | #FFFCEE        | both      | see above | 
|      |                |           |           | 
| **solid**  | #1B525C        |           | #80C87F   |
|       | #80C87F        |           | #1B525C   |
|       | #FFFCEE        |           | #1B525C   |

This colour refers to the review stars, that is the *only* place where this colour is used.
