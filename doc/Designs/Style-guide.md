## Colour use
Here, 'blocks' refers to the blocks of colour, or cards, seen on the site. Their purpose is to add a little more interesting and colourfull visuals to the site. 

The background of the site is standard the off-white colour, but to add more variation pages have different backgrounds per section. One section is one topic.

|    | **Background** | **Block** | **Text**  |
|------------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| **blocks** | #1B525C        | #80C87F   | #1B525C   
|      | #80C87F        | #1B525C   | #FFFCEE   |  
|       | #FFFCEE        | both      | see above | 
|      |                |           |           | 
| **solid**  | #1B525C        |           | #80C87F   |
|       | #80C87F        |           | #1B525C   |

### Main
The main colour is used most on the site, if the is another colour background the first choice is the main colour. 
### secondary
The secondary colour is to be used as background when bordering the main colour. It is to balance out how bright the site is and is used only a little less than the main colour.
### Highlight
The highlight colour is used when there is an edge of the two colours that the elemnt overlaps with. This is for example the case with some buttons that are placed on edges to add dimention.
### Background
The background is an off-white, this is the standard colour.
### Stars
This colour refers to the review stars, that is the *only* place where this colour is used.

## Lay-out
All topics are assigned to a section, as explained before these sections have diffrent background-colours. The title of a section is always in bold and what HTML calls font-size xx-large. All elements are borderless.

The cards are rounded at the corners. the rounding depends on the size of the card and is based on view height, use 5svh for the correct rounding. All cards on the home page that are in a row horizontally have unalignment. Cards stay withing the same section and dont overlap. Forms and buttons are allowed to overlap.

Cards, images and titles all have boxshadows of 2svh by 2svw with a colour of #07102630. This is a small box and even boxshadow with a very dark and low opacity blue.
